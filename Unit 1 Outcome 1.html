    <h3>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h3>
    <p id="home-page-content">Information technology has an essential role in business's daily operations and success.
         Modern business use information technology to increase productivity and efficiency. Information Technology helps businesses to save costs , improve customer experience and to enhance communication . It plays role in helping businesses to expand.

    <h3>1.2 Describe methods, skills and resources
            needed to complete digital projects successfully 
    </h3>
    <p>Digital Projects like any other project needs planning before its development. Listing resources, selection of IT tools needed to complete the digital project is also part of the planning. Then before the development, the design is created.
        After planning comes the development stage. This is where the project starts to come to existence. After the development, the project is reviewed and tested and if the test identifies any issues then those are fixed and it is tested again. This is repeated until we get a working product which fulfils the intended purpose.
        Digital projects need skills to fulfil them. Skills to use tools available for the project development e.g. if a programming language is being used then knowledge of coding in that specific language is essential. To manage the project, project management skill is required. Communication skills and problem-solving skills are also needed.
        Flowchart help visualize the project before its development. Kanban boards are a good way of managing digital projects and help in keeping track of the progress.

    <h3>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making
        your website
        </h3>
    <p>It was my first solo project as the last project we worked on was a group project. This time it was different. I have learned a lot by trail and error.
        It was a vague plan to start with but thing started to get clearer with time.I have been recently introduced to Trello board. It has helped me to keep track of my progress but I am not used to it yet so I used pen and paper to sketch tasks before doing them and that is how I organise and manage my project. Due to time constrain I have spent a lot of time on this project. Search on the internet also helped me to find the new ways to work with different elements.
        I complied the code in Visual Studio. Used trello board to keep track of the progress. Used Inter Explorer and Google Chrome to test the website and github to publish it.
        
    </p>
    <h3>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital
        projects-what causes digital projects To fail? Why?
        </h3>
    <p>Digital project can fail for many reason.
        There are always risks. Poor planning can be one reason. Lake of resources or undertaking project which are beyond our capabilities can also cause the digital project to fail. Inaccurate estimates of the resources required will also affect the project. 
        
    </p>
    <h3>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting
        and using IT systems and software 
        </h3>
    <p>To select the right kind of IT system and software one should  see what are their needs and what kind of system can fulfil them. Also we need to see if we have skill to make use of those system and software to get the results. In this instance I used Visual Code to compile my code , used trello to manage the project and to keep track of my progress.To publish my website I used github.
    </p>
    <h3>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your
        chosen technologies have helped you achieve
        your outcomes. 
        </h3>
    <p></p>I have used visual code to compile all the code for this project. It provides coding assistance where it helps you with parameters info and sometimes even do code completion.
    Trello is a very simple yet powerful tool to plan, organise and manage projects. I have only been using it for a short period of time and still learning how to make full use of it but still it made it easier for me to organise my project and also keeping track of my progress. GitHub provides free website hosting. The basic working version of the website can be uploaded and can re upload the improved version which will then replace the older version with the latest one.
    
    </p>
    <h3>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that
        impact digital projects 
        
        </h3>
    <p>There are legal guidelines which have to stick to while working on digital project. A persons creative work is his property. There are laws and regulation to protect people’s work. Then there are laws which regulates the handling of people personal data. General Data Protection Regulation(GDRP) is such a law.
        We have to be thoughtful of what we put on our websites and how we handle people personal data.[1]<br>
