        <h3>My Background.</h3>
        <p>My name is Adeel. I am an aspiring web developer based in Manchester.  </p>
        <h3>Why I am learning coding.</h3>
       I wanted to learn coding for quite some time but it is only recently I started<br> 
       learning coding at Codenation Manchester. I really like it.The thing I enjoy <br>
       most about coding is how it keeps you in a problem solving mood most of the time.<br> 
       I regret that I should have started it long ago. I see myself as a talented person<br> 
       and want to present myself for an opportunity to learn it further so I can make this<br>
       a career.
