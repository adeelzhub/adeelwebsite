               Create structures and styles for a webpage
            </h2>
            <h3>1.1 Describe the content and layout for each
               page
            </h3>
            <p>My website has seven pages. The landing page is home/welcome page. One page is my introduction which has some details about me. Then there is a page dedicated to each section of  assignment which is referred as outcome. 
                All pages have same background for consistency and user friendliness. Each page is divided in two parts left panel and the right panel. Both panels have different colour background. Left panel is fixed and bears the main heading of the page. This is either title of the page or the name of the related project? Right panel has a tidy navigation bar on top of the page with links to the other pages. Right panel also got the main contents of the website. The contents of right panel are scrollable.
                
            </p>
            <h3>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints
                affecting websites
            </h3>
            <p>While creating websites we have to be very thoughtful of the the contents. A person or institution has a right of ownership to its creation.
                There are rules and reagulation which we have to follow to avoid getting into trouble.
                General Data Protection Regulation(GDRP) regulates the handling of people personal data. People data cannot be and should not be used without their consent.

            <h3>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into
                account - describe issues that people with
                disabilities may face when using webpages and
                how we can overcome them
            </h3>
            <p>Web accessibility refers to the extent to which a website is usable by its intended users taking into account their differing capabilities.[1]
                To make WebPages more accessible there are few things which should be taken into account.
                Visually impaired person may not be able to see an image displayed but a text description can help them to understand what is being displayed.
                If the webpage is not navigatable without mouse then it can be a problem for someone who cannot use mouse to navigate. A webpage should be structured in way that it can be navigated logically using tab key.
                Some people find animation or moving object really distractive. There should be an option to stop or pause animations.
                Some forms expire after a certain time. Screen readers take longer to read them. User should be informed when the form is going to expire and they should have an option to extend the time.<br>

            <h3>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes
                for websites
                </h3>
            <p>I came across three types of filetypes during my project.Hyper Text Markup Language, Cascading Style Sheet for coding and Jpeg for images. I am also aware that mp3 filytype is a common filetype for audios and music. For videos mp4 filetypes are used.
