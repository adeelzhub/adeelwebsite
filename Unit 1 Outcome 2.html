        <p">Visual studio is a  powerful coding tool. It is easy to use. Navigation between files is very simple.It has a powerful debugger. It has a feature where it provides coding assistance. When you type a tag it types the closing tag. It helps you with parameters info and sometimes even code completion.
            Trello I’m not sure as I did use it but mainly I use pen and paper to create smaller task to complete the project as that what I am used to but will definitely explore it further. GitHub is wonderful. Straight forward and easy to use tool to publish your website. You can keep improving yor website and update it on gitHub and it will publish your recent work.

            appropriate

        <p">For my project the tools I selected were the appropriate tools in my opinion. Visual studio is the best IDE I have known so far. It is very easy to use. Navigation between files is very simple.It has a powerful debugger. It provides coding assistance where it helps you with parameters info and sometimes even code completion. Trello is a simple yet powerful project management tool. It let you split project into small tasks and you can priorities thing to help manage the project. Although I am new to trello board, It has been a really handy tool to keep track of my progress. </p>

            final project 
            </h3>
        <p">I wanted to work more on this website so I could try to use everything I have learned at Codenation to make it look better. I will keep working on my website to make it better. 
            I would like to add more effects to it to make it look more visual.eg I wanted to give my webpage a glossy look but I did not have time to search the way to do it due to time restraint.
            Since it has been my first solo project and it is the first website I have created I am happy. It has been a very good experience.
             </p>
        <h3>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make
            to your project
            </h3>
        <p">If I had more time I had tons of ideas to improve my website. I would like to work on the appearance, navigation; friendliness.I would like to add some kind of user interaction on the website. I would have worked more on the contents of the website.</p>
        <h3>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match
            requirements and are fit for purpose
            </h3>
        <p>I have made efforts to built my website as per requirements. I Included all the answers. I have made use of tools available to complete this project.
            But I will love to know what other people think about it.
