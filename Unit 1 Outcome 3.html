    <h2 style="font-size: 40px;">Unit: 1 Outcome: 3<br>Develop and test solutions to improve ongoing use of IT tools and systems. </h2>
        <h3>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools
            and systems used in terms of productivity and
            efficiency 
            </h3>
        <p">I can talk about benefits of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency as I did not find any drawbacks because firstly I had nothing else to compare them with secondly being new to coding I know for sure they make things easier. These tools are good. They are easy to use yet very productive, efficient and powerful tools.
            If It was a group/team project could it have been better? yes definitely. Teams are not only a better way to achieve things but also a training ground for people with in the team. Every team member brings a different skill to the team and other team member get to learn from it.  
            Work load is divided and it is fun to work with people rather than working alone.
            </p>
        <h3>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and
            efficiency
            </h3>
        <p">There are two ways to increase productivity, work more hours or work smarter. In the begging of  the project I was not working smarter I was doing hours, never looked at the time. Fewer breaks or sometimes no breaks at all. 
            but that was not efficient way.
            Woring smarter is the key to improve productivity and efficiency.
            Keeping track of the progress and then planning your work accordingly is a productive and efficient approach.
            Taking regular breaks gives you a fresh start every time.
            Also something I have learnt from my experience is that one should avoid multitasking while coding as this only causes confusion. It makes you more tired and effects your efficiency.
            Having minimal intruption also improve the quality of results.
            </p>
        <h3>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity
            using IT in digital projects 
            </h3>
        <p">Effective communication is crucial for productivity. I would  use slack to get in touch with people in my group If I need help with my project. Also for testing  digital project.It is a good to get other people opinion .  </p>
        <h3>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing
            digital solutions
            </h3>
        <p">Testing is very important part of developing digital solutions. Testing tells us if our product fulfils the intended purpose and it enable us minimise the errors or any other issues before it gets to the intended user or users. e.g we learn if there are any device compatible issues. 
            I will ask people in my circle to test my project and give me feedback so I could learn how they see my project and if they find any issue with it. I will try to fix it.
